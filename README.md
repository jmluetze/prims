Implementation of Prims algorithm written by Jonathan Luetze

Based on the input of a text file, the algorithm creates a graph using prims algorithm

Files and their meanings:

1. main.c - This is the main file
2. binheap.c - Contains functions specific to the Binomial Heap
3. dll.c - Contains functions specific to the doubly-linked list and queue used for this algorithm
4. vertex.c - Creates and compares vertices
5. node.h - Defines the node structure
6. array.c - Contains methods specific to the 2D dynamic array used for this algorithm
7. scanner.c - Contains methods to read in tokens from file

Commands:
- To create the exectuable, execute the command "make"
- To execute the graph files, execute the command "make tester"
- To clean up the files, execute the command "make clean"
